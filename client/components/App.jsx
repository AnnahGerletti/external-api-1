//In HTML, form elements such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select> typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input

//Specifying the value prop on a controlled component prevents the user from changing the input unless you desire so. If youâ€™ve specified a value but the input is still editable, you may have accidentally set value to undefined or null.

//The form was submitting and was not suppose to => check for spellling errors

//Checking to see if the api call was made check the network tab in the console browser

//adding more console.log() to check the res, also expanding the response in the console to see what was sent back

//setState look at the react tab console
